All code is based on the CS 340 starter code.

We used the CS340 starter guide as the base for our app.py, as well as for our html files. From the CS340 starter guide, we also used @mlapresta's db_connector.py and db_credentials.py. 

Beyond that, we referred to the official flask and jinja documentation to build upon the CS 340 starter code. The flask documentation was helpful for learning more about requesting data, redirections, and variable rules. The jinja documentation helped us learn how to use if's, for's, and variables in the html files.
